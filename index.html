                <p> I’ve always been fascinated by art and this has fueled my interest design. Combined with the itch to make everyday tasks more efficient and easy to complete, by anyone, these have aroused a curiosity in learning about user experience design. I am always trying to learn as much as possible. I am a big fan of efficiently designed things/processes/tasks. I like seeing things go from raw/rough to polished and refined. Over the years I freelanced for brands, song art, logos etc. and I’m excited to explore the user experience side of design.
